# Database Project

## Car Rental company asked you to implement a system with the following features:
- The system should be able to register a new car (model, year, plate id, etc.) and update car status (active, out of service, rented, etc.),
- Customers will be able to reserve their cars from anywhere in the world via this system (Multiple offices).
- Customers provide information to this application by filling in their personal information to create an account and then he or she can reserve a car.
- The proposed system effectively and efficiently automates manual procedures for car reservation (reserve, pick up, return, payment, etc.).
- Customers are aided by your system to search the available cars by any of the car specs according to their needs.

- All reservations within a specified period including all car and customer information.
- The status of all cars on a specific day.
- All reservations of specific customer including customer information, car model and plate id.
- Daily payments within specific period.
